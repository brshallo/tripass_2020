# tripass_2020

Slides for "R as Interface for Analysis in Databases" presentation to Tripass, the Triangle's SQL Server User community, delivered on 2020-09-01: https://www.meetup.com/tripass/events/272498799/

I added more explicit references to sites where materials were pulled from (added links to each page to supplement reference page at the end). As noted, most of these slides were pulled from documentation of sites mantained by Rstudio or from presentations delivered by Edgar Ruiz (an Enterprise Architect at Rstudio). For demos and more details, I highly recommend those resources.

Also note that in many parts of the presentation I skipped `library()` statements and did not reference functions explicitly (i.e. `fun()` rather than `pkg::fun()`). Again, check-out the sources for more detailed information on which packages the functions my examples are coming from.
